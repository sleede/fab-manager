    = Pagination
    ---
    You can ask for pagination on your requests, by providing the GET parameters *page* and *per_page* (when it's available).
    The meta-data about pagination will be returned in the headers, following RFC-5988 standard for web linking.
    It uses headers *Link*, *Total* and *Per-Page*.

    = Authentication
    ---
    Authentication is done using *Authorization* header.
    You just have to set header *Authorization* to <tt>Token token=YOUR_TOKEN</tt> for every request.

    = Json
    ---
    Depending on your client, you may have to set header <tt>Accept: application/json</tt> for every request,
    otherwise some clients may request *html* by default which will result in error.

    = Amounts
    ---
    Everywhere in the OpenAPI amounts are reported in cents. For exemple, if you get <tt>{ "amount" : 1000 }</tt>,
    from the OpenAPI, this means that the price is 10 â‚¬ (or whatever your currency is).
