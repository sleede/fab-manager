## Introduction

The following environment variables configure the addresses of the databases, some credentials, some application behaviours and the localization preferences.
If you are in a development environment, your can keep most of the default values, otherwise, in production, values must be configured carefully.

The settings in [.env](../env.example) configure the environment variables when the application run in development mode.
If you run the application in production with docker, the settings are localized in [config/env](../setup/env.example).

<a name="general-settings"></a>
## General settings
<a name="POSTGRES_HOST"></a>

    POSTGRES_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the PostgreSQL database of the application (see [PostgreSQL](../README.md#postgresql)).
This value is only used when deploying in production, otherwise this is configured in [config/database.yml](../config/database.yml.default).
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`postgres` by default).
<a name="POSTGRES_PASSWORD"></a><a name="POSTGRES_USERNAME"></a>

    POSTGRES_USERNAME, POSTGRES_PASSWORD

Username and password for the connection to the PostgreSQL database.
This value is only used when deploying in production, otherwise this is configured in [config/database.yml](../config/database.yml.default).
When using docker-compose, the default configuration (with `postgres` user) does not uses any password as it is confined in the docker container.
<a name="REDIS_HOST"></a>

    REDIS_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the redis database.
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`redis` by default).
<a name="ELASTICSEARCH_HOST"></a>

    ELASTICSEARCH_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the elasticSearch database.
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`elasticsearch` by default).
<a name="SECRET_KEY_BASE"></a>

    SECRET_KEY_BASE

Used by the authentication system to generate random tokens, eg. for resetting passwords.
Used by Rails to verify the integrity of signed cookies.
You can generate such a random key by running `rails secret`.
<a name="DELIVERY_METHOD"></a>

    DELIVERY_METHOD

Configure the Rails' Action Mailer delivery method.
See http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration for more details.
<a name="SMTP_ADDRESS"></a><a name="SMTP_PORT"></a><a name="SMTP_USER_NAME"></a><a name="SMTP_PASSWORD"></a><a name="SMTP_AUTHENTICATION"></a><a name="SMTP_ENABLE_STARTTLS_AUTO"></a><a name="SMTP_OPENSSL_VERIFY_MODE"></a>

    SMTP_ADDRESS, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER_NAME, SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_AUTHENTICATION, SMTP_ENABLE_STARTTLS_AUTO & SMTP_OPENSSL_VERIFY_MODE

<a name="SMTP_CA_FILE"></a>

    SMTP_CA_FILE

The path to a file containing a PEM-format CA certificate.
See [OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html).
This is an undocumented setting of [mail gem](https://github.com/mikel/mail).
In production with Docker, you may need to mount your certificate into the running container, by adding an entry in your [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/blob/master/setup/docker-compose.yml), under `services > fabmanager > volumes`, like the following: `- ${PWD}/certs/ca-cert-file.pem:/etc/ssl/my-certs/ca-cert-file.pem`
<a name="SMTP_CA_PATH"></a>

    SMTP_CA_PATH

The path to a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
See [OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html).
This is an undocumented setting of [mail gem](https://github.com/mikel/mail).
In production with Docker, you may need to mount your certificate into the running container, by adding an entry in your [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/blob/master/setup/docker-compose.yml), under `services > fabmanager > volumes`, like the following: `- ${PWD}/certs:/etc/ssl/my-certs`
<a name="SMTP_TLS"></a>

<a name="DEFAULT_HOST"></a><a name="DEFAULT_PROTOCOL"></a>

    DEFAULT_HOST, DEFAULT_PROTOCOL

Your members will receive email notifications containing links to your of Fab-manager.
You must properly configure these variables to match URL of this instance, to prevent broken links.
Typically, `DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` will be `https` (`http` if you are in development, or if you set `ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`).
The variable `DEFAULT_HOST` should be your domain name (eg. fabmanager.example.com), and is also used for visits statistics (configuration of Google Analytics).
These two variables are also used for SSO authentication.
<a name="LOG_LEVEL"></a>

    LOG_LEVEL

<a name="ADMIN_EMAIL"></a><a name="ADMIN_PASSWORD"></a>

    ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD

Credentials for the first admin user created when seeding the project.
By default, these variables are not present in the env file, because they are only used once, when running the database seed with the command `rails db:seed`.
<a name="ADMINSYS_EMAIL"></a>

If you're using Fab-manager on a non-public network or for testing purposes, you can disable this behavior by setting this variable to `true`.
Please, ensure you know what you're doing, as this can lead to serious security issues.
<a name="LOCKED_SETTINGS"></a>

    LOCKED_SETTINGS

See `config/locales/app.*.yml` for a list of available locales. Default is **en**.
<a name="RAILS_LOCALE"></a>

    RAILS_LOCALE

Configure Ruby on Rails localization settings (currency, dates, number formats ...).

Please, be aware that **the configured locale will imply the CURRENCY symbol used to generate invoices**.

_Eg.: configuring **es-ES** will set the currency symbol to **â‚¬** but **es-MX** will set **$** as currency symbol, so setting the `RAILS_LOCALE` to simple **es** (without country indication) will probably not do what you expect._

Available values: `en, en-AU-CA, en-GB, en-IE, en-IN, en-NZ, en-US, en-ZA, fr, fr-CA, fr-CH, fr-CM, fr-FR, es, es-419, es-AR, es-CL, es-CO, es-CR, es-DO, es-EC, es-ES, es-MX, es-MX, es-PA, es-PE, es-US, es-VE, no, pt, pt-BR, it, it-CH, zu`.
When not defined, it defaults to **en**.

If your locale is not present in that list or any locale doesn't have your exact expectations, please open a pull request to share your modifications with the community and obtain a rebuilt docker image.

<a name="other-settings"></a>
## Other settings

In the previous versions of Fab-manager, much more settings were configurable from environment variables.
Starting with Fab-manager v4.5.0, these settings can be configured from the graphical interface, when logged as an administrator.

Nevertheless, it is possible to keep the configuration in the `env` file, using a combination of [`LOCKED_SETTINGS`](environment.md#LOCKED_SETTINGS), `rails fablab:setup:env_to_db` and the [mapping table of `env_to_db`](../lib/tasks/fablab/setup.rake#L105).
