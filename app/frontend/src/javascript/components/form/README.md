# components/from

This directory is holding the inputs components for usage within forms controlled by [React-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

All these components must have [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) that inherit from [FormComponent](../models/form-component.ts) 
or from [FormControlledComponent](../models/form-component.ts).

Please look at the existing components for examples.
